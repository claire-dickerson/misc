# Welcome to my misc file!
Here is where all my private projects live. My Animal Crossing project, for example, includes an exploratory data analysis of Animal Crossing villager data, as well a very simple predictive model to determine the popularity of villagers. Any further important details about the project(s) are included in the notebooks themselves.
